description: Native spider to Astralis. Uses a large artillery cannon to shoot.
details: "A cannon is mounted on the back of this spider. Strange. It must have been mounted by Sharded as an attempt to create a biomechanical unit. They were successful up to an extent. Keep in mind, even if it is large, this is still [accent]an infant[]."
