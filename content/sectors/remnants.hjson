[Incoming message from superintendent TARTAR-us]

An old [accent]monazite[] mining operation existed here. While monazite itself is [accent]useless in buildings, it is a key ingredient to producing new materials[].

This area is heavily guarded, but it may take a while before detection. The enemies will attack in few but dense groups. Expect tier 3 units.
