# **How to properly contribute, and why your issue got closed.**

## **I cannot understand your issue.**

Either your issue is in another language, or does not make sense to me. Either way, if I cannot understand what you need, I cannot fix it.

## **Your issue has already been fixed.**

Your issue has been fixed and you did not notice.

## **It's a problem with another mod.**

Another mod is causing the issue.

## **The issue cannot be fixed.**

It's a problem with mindustry itself or your device, or hjson is too limited to fix/improve it.

## **It isn't an issue, you did something wrong ingame.**

# **What can be done about this?**

- If you do not speak english, then use a translator.

- Update to check if the bug has been fixed.

- Make sure it is an actual bug. Research everything you can, and for the love of god, READ DESCRIPTIONS, DETAILS AND INSTRUCTIONS.

- Check if the issue happens with other mods installed, and if it does, make sure it isn't Astralis causing the bug.
